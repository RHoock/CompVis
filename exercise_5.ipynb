    "where $\\rho$ denotes the *correlation coefficient*; $dt$ is the time shift, and $\\mu_{x}$ and $\\mu_{y}$ are the means of the two signals $x$ and $y$. The denominator normalizes the correlation coefficient such that $\\rho \\in [-1,1]$, the bounds indicate maximum correlation and $0$ means no correlation at all. The sums are only evaluated for indices where both $x_i$ and $y_{i+dt}$ exist.\n",

    "In this exercise, we will deal with the first problem of stereo vision:  the *correspondence problem*. For each image point in the left image, we want to find the corresponding point in the right image which is the projection of the same 3D-point.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keep in mind**: x denotes the horizontal axis of an image, in a numpy matrix this is the second axis (column x). Accordingly, y is the vertical axis in an image, which is the first axis in a numpy matrix (row y).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our basic assumption is that corresponding image regions are similar, i.e. correlated. For each image pixel in the left image we are searching for its best match in the right image (or vice versa). Matching only single pixels results in too many false positives, so we choose a neighborhood window around the pixel and correlate it with all candidate blocks in the right image to find its best match (*block matching*). We assume rectified images, i.e. the epipolar lines are aligned, so we only need to search along the horizontal direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible similarity measures for block matching:\n",

Note that $dx$ is zero as we are only searching for horizontal shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to find for each pixel $(x,y)$ the disparity $(0,dy)$ that either minimizes the error (sum of squared differences) or maximizes the similarity (cross-correlation). \n",
    "In order to do this, we need to search over a range of disparities up to an allowed maximum disparity. \n",
    "The output is the so-called `disparity map`: a map where pixel intensities describe the relative depth of points within a scene.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement functions `stereo_corr_...(left, right, win_size, max_disp)` which returns the disparity map `disp_map` for the stereo image pair `left` and `right`, given a correlation window size `win_size` and an upper limit on the allowed disparity range `max_disp`. Implement both the SSD and NCC-based block matching and match from left to right (i.e., for each window in the left image, search in the right image, so that the disparity map is with respect to the left image). \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: When coded as nested `for` loops in python, this can be very slow. Be creative about how you code this. Using **convolution** (e.g. `cv2.blur`) is one possibility.\n",

    "* try out different window sizes (e.g. `win_size` 3, 5, 9, 11),\n",
    "* try out different values of maximum disparity (e.g. 10, 16),\n",
    "* compare the results obtained with SSD and NCC.\n",
